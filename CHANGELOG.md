## [Unreleased]

### Planned

- MCP stdio server.
- Hardened local dashboard.
- Installer with backups and managed blocks.
- Schema migrations.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-07

### Added

- Local Markdown store with project cards, generated index, recent activity,
  and a metadata-only JSONL audit log.
- CLI commands: `init`, `remember`, `search`, `show`, `list`, `recent`,
  `forget`, `export`, `reindex`, `doctor`, `path`, `mcp`, `dashboard`, and
  `install`.
- Path jail with component validation and symlink resolution.
- Atomic UTF-8 writes and private directories.
- Best-effort redaction for common API keys, tokens, private keys, bearer
  tokens, credential assignments, and email addresses.
- Portable `AGENTS.md` and `SKILL.md` templates plus rules for OpenCode,
  Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf.
- Dry-run agent installer.
- Pytest suite, GitHub Actions CI, Dependabot configuration, and a repository
  hygiene checker.
- English and Turkish README files.

### Security

- Destructive `forget` requires `--yes` and moves cards to `trash/`.
- Card scanning rejects symlinks and non-regular files.
- `append_text()` rejects symlink targets.
- The core makes no network calls and has no runtime dependencies.

### Known limitations

- MCP and dashboard are stubs.
- The installer does not modify files.
- No encryption at rest, cloud sync, or Git push.
- No multi-process write lock.
- Redaction is best-effort, not a guarantee.
